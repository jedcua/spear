#System for Plate Evaluation, Assessment, and Recognition [SPEAR]

License Plate Recognition system developed as an output of our 
undergraduate thesis written in Python.

It features reading the alphanumeric code from a license plate and
performing a database lookup for evaluating possible violations
related to that license plate.

The database lookup currently checks for the following:
    - Unregistered plates
    - Expired plates
    - Wanted/Reported plates
    - Stolen plates
